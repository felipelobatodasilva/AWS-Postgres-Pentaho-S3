# Postgres

In this tutorial, I will show how to create a sample database downloaded on the web known as SportsDB for Postgres.

This sample can be downloaded in the following link:

http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/samples

Once you've downloaded this file and unzip the script to a specific path as choosen by you, don't forget where is it!

Before, you keep doing the footsteps, I recommend you to check whether Postgres 11 version is installed on your local machine.

If you don't have Postgres version 11 installed yet. Just ckick on the link below to download it

Hence, I will open PG Admin 4 and start the process of reading the script we do

1) Use the right click of the mouse on Databases and then Select Create -> Database

2) Give a name to the database and save it

3) Load the script into Query Tool by using the right click on SportsDB and select Query Tools

4) Once you have already opened the Query Tool just import the script.sql for it. 
Now is essential that you remember where you saved it as mentioned previously.
For that just clck on open file icon
